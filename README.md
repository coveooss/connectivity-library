# Connectivity Library
The Coveo GitHub Connectivity Library is an open source repository containing sample JSON configurations. These examples allow you to index popular systems that Coveo doesn't provide a [native connector](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/#native-connectors) for, but which expose a REST or GraphQL API. Copy the content of the relevant sample JSON configuration file from this library and paste it directly into your [Coveo Platform](http://platform.cloud.coveo.com/) [REST API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) or [GraphQL API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/n6gh2329/) source **JSON configuration** box.

## Disclaimer
The Coveo GitHub Connectivity Library contains examples of repositories that have been indexed using Coveo's REST API or GraphQL API connector. When using the search box on the [Add a source of content](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3390/index-content/add-or-edit-a-source#add-a-source) panel, Coveo recommends using the REST API or GraphQL API source and the associated sample configuration for a subset of the listed systems. These recommendations are warranted based on a higher degree of testing in proofs of concepts.

Please be aware that all library configurations, including those recommended on the Coveo Platform, are not actively maintained or officially supported. Consider them as starting points that you’ll need to customize to your specific use case.

> **_NOTE:_**  If you want to index a repository that doesn’t appear in the library, it's quite possible you'll be able to do so using one of Coveo's [generic connectors](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/#generic-connectors).

## Requirements
To use the configuration examples in this library you must have:
* A [Coveo organization](https://docs.coveo.com/en/2959/).
* Basic knowledge of the Coveo [REST API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) and [GraphQL API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/n6gh2329/) sources.
