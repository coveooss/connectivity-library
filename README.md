# Connectivity Library
The Coveo GitHub Connectivity Library is an open source repository where we can share all our knowledge around connectivity capabilities for the Coveo Platform.

**Note: This repository is not meant to be used directly from your machine, but for its examples to be copied and pasted directly into your [Coveo organization](http://platform.cloud.coveo.com/).**

## Before You Start
Learn more about [Coveo's connectivity options](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/). You will understand how Coveo indexes different repositories and you will find a list of all repositories to which Coveo can connect.

The Coveo GitHub Connectivity Library contains examples of repositories that have been indexed using Coveo's REST API connector. However, this list isn’t exhaustive. If you want to index a repository that doesn’t appear in the library, you can probably do so thanks to one of Coveo's [generic connectors](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/#generic-connectors).

### Requirements
To use the configuration examples in this library you must have:
* A Coveo organization.
* Basic knowledge on [how to configure a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/).
