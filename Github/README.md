# Indexing GitHub using the Coveo REST API connector

This guide explains how you can use the content of the provided JSON files in a [REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) to index repositories, branches, and other content types. Your Coveo source will use the selected JSON configuration to customize HTTP requests for the GitHub REST API and identify the pieces of content to extract from the responses.

This guide covers two use cases:
- Indexing without taking account of permissions.
- Indexing and taking account of permissions.

## Advisory

When [adding a source of content](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3390/index-content/add-or-edit-a-source#add-a-source) in the [Coveo Administration Console](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1841/), Coveo may recommend, or not recommend, using a Coveo [REST API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) or [GraphQL API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/n6gh2329/) source along with the associated example JSON configuration from this library. Coveoâ€™s recommendation depends on the extent of testing of the system example configuration in proofs of concept.

However, please note that all configurations in this library, including those recommended in the Coveo Administration Console, aren't actively maintained or officially supported. Consider them as starting points that will require adjustments to fit your specific use case.

## Prerequisites

To fully understand and effectively use the example JSON configurations, you must:
- Have a [Coveo organization](https://docs.coveo.com/en/185).
- Learn about [Coveo connectivity](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702).
- Learn [how to configure a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/).

## Use case 1: Indexing GitHub without security

1. Follow the [Web Application Flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) steps to get an OAuth 2.0 token.
2. [Create a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) and, in the **Authorization** section, provide your token.
3. Use the example in [`SourceJSONConfig.json`](SourceJSONConfig.json) as a base to build your source JSON configuration. Adjust it to your own needs.
4. Make sure you've changed all placeholders in the configuration with your own values.
5. [Create the appropiate fields and mappings](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/#completion).
6. Check whether your source indexes the desired content properly. You might find you need an additional [indexing pipeline extension](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1645/) to achieve the expected result.

## Use case 2: Indexing GitHub with security and members in SSO

You want to index the collaborators of each repository and use them for security trimming.

During indexing we assign the `RepoMembersGroup` using the `name` of the repository as an `Allowed permission`.

During the Security Cache expansion, we resolve the groups to a valid email address as follows:

1. For each `RepoMembersGroup`, we request the `/collaborators`. This will give us all the usernames from GitHub. We put them into `GithubUserGroupMember` using the `login` information from the `/collaborators` call.
2. We map the `GithubUserGroupMember` to an actual email address. For this, we use a `GraphQL` query against GitHub. This will translate a `login` like `wim` into `wim@coveo.com`.

**Example of the flow**

1. Index repository `coveo-labs/searchkit-proxy`.
2. For each item in this repository, assign `PermissionsSets>AllowedMembers`.

   - Type: `Group`
   - PermissionType: `RepoMembersGroup`
   - AdditionalInfo (this is used in the Security Cache): `groupid: searchkit-proxy`

3. During Security Cache refresh/update, all needed `AdditionalInfo->groupid` are expanded. For each `groupid`, ask GitHub for collaborators using `coveo-labs/[groupid]/collaborators` (in our example, `coveo-labs/searchkit-proxy/collaborators`).

   Example results:

   - Type: `User`
   - PermissionType: `GithubUserGroupMember`
   - AdditionalInfo: `login: wim`

   - Type: `User`
   - PermissionType: `GithubUserGroupMember`
   - AdditionalInfo: `login: jerome`

4. The second step in the Security Cache expansion is to retrieve mappings for each `login`. Using the `/graphql` GitHub call, we execute a request for each `login`.

   Example results:

   - For login: "wim"
     Result: "wim@coveo.com" (`%[node.samlIdentity.nameId]`)

   - For login: "jerome"
     Result: "jerome@coveo.com" (`%[node.samlIdentity.nameId]`)

Now the Security Cache knows exactly how a `Group`, expands to a `Collaborator user`, and how it maps to a `Email Security Provider`

**Instructions**

1. Follow the [Web Application Flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) steps to get an OAuth 2.0 token.
2. [Create a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) and, in the **Authorization** section, provide your token.
3. Use the example in [`SecuredSourceJSON_Config.json`](./SecuredSourceJSON_Config.json) as a base to build your source JSON configuration. Adjust it to your own needs.
4. Under the `Content Security` tab, select **Same users and groups as in your current permission system** and use the example in [`SecuredSourceJSON_ContentSecurity.json`](./SecuredSourceJSON_ContentSecurity.json) as a base to build your source [**JSON permissions configuration**](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3303/). Adjust it to your own needs. Use a proper account for the SSO GraphQL call.
5. Make sure you've changed all placeholders in the configuration with your own values.
6. [Create the appropiate fields and mappings](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/#completion).
7. Check whether your source indexes the desired content properly. You might find you need an additional [indexing pipeline extension](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1645/) to achieve the expected result.
