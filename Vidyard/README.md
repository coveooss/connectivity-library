# Indexing Vidyard using the Coveo REST API connector

This guide explains how you can use the content of the [`SourceJSONConfig.json`](SourceJSONConfig.json) file in a [REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) to index players and videos. Your Coveo source will use this JSON configuration to customize HTTP requests for the Vidyard v1 API and identify the specific content to extract from the responses.

## Advisory

When [adding a source of content](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3390/index-content/add-or-edit-a-source#add-a-source) in the [Coveo Administration Console](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1841/), Coveo may recommend, or not recommend, using a Coveo [REST API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) or [GraphQL API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/n6gh2329/) source along with the associated example JSON configuration from this library. Coveoâ€™s recommendation depends on the extent of testing of the system example configuration in proofs of concept.

However, please note that all configurations in this library, including those recommended in the Coveo Administration Console, aren't actively maintained or officially supported. Consider them as starting points that will require customization to fit your specific use case.

## Prerequisites

To fully understand and effectively use the example JSON configuration, you must:
- Have a [Coveo organization](https://docs.coveo.com/en/185).
- Learn about [Coveo connectivity](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702).
- Learn [how to configure a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/).

## Instructions

1. Obtain crawling credentials: [The Vidyard API](https://developer.vidyard.com/) will allow you to authenticate with the token. The API Token can be found from the side menu, select Admin > API Tokens
2. [Create a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) and, in the **Authorization** section, fill in you username and the API Token obtained in step 1. as the password.
3. Use the example in [`SourceJSONConfig.json`](SourceJSONConfig.json) as a base to build your source JSON configuration. Adjust it to your own needs.
4. [Create the appropiate fields and mappings](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/#completion).
5. Check whether your source indexes the desired content properly. You might find you need an [indexing pipeline extension](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1645/) to achieve the expected result.
