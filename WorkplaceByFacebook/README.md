# Indexing Workplace by Facebook using the Coveo REST API connector

This guide explains how you can use the content of the provided JSON files in [REST API sources](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) to index groups, members, comments, and numerous other Worklace community objects. Your Coveo sources will use these JSON configurations to customize HTTP requests for the Facebook Graph API and identify the pieces of content to extract from the responses.

## Advisory

When [adding a source of content](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3390/index-content/add-or-edit-a-source#add-a-source) in the [Coveo Administration Console](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1841/), Coveo may recommend, or not recommend, using a Coveo [REST API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/) or [GraphQL API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/n6gh2329/) source along with the associated example JSON configuration from this library. Coveoâ€™s recommendation depends on the extent of testing of the system example configuration in proofs of concept.

However, please note that all configurations in this library, including those recommended in the Coveo Administration Console, aren't actively maintained or officially supported. Consider them as starting points that will require customization to fit your specific use case.

## Prerequisites

To fully understand and effectively use the example JSON configurations, you must:
- Have a [Coveo organization](https://docs.coveo.com/en/185).
- Learn about [Coveo connectivity](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702).
- Learn [how to configure a REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/).

## Instructions

1. [Create a Custom Integration into Workplace by Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/custom-integrations-new/).
2. Make sure the Integration has the following access: Read group content, Read user timeline, Read user email, Read group membership, Read all messages, Create link previews, Read work profile, Manage Knowledge Library content, and Manage work profiles.
3. Activate the Feature Flag: `Generic rest permissions config`.
4. To index your Workplace by Facebook content, you will need to [create three REST API sources](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/): one for the content that supports incremental indexing, two for the content that does not support incremental indexing. For each source you create, follow steps 4 to 7.
5. In the **Authentication** section, enter your Workplace by Facebook access token under **API key authentication**.
6. In the **Content to include** section, paste one of the following configurations:
    - For your first non incremental indexing source, enter the [`NormalConfig.json`](NormalConfig.json) configuration.
    - For your second incremental indexing source, enter the [`MembersInfoConfig.json`](MembersInfoConfig.json) configuration.
    - For the incremental indexing source, enter the [`IncrementalConfig.json`](IncrementalConfig.json) configuration.
7. (Optional) After saving the source, and you forgot to change the security setting: Now change the [`createSecurityProvider.py`](Extensions/createSecurityProvider.py) script.
   - Change the `organizationId`, `sourceId` and the `authToken`.
   - Execute the script. This will create a security provider for your source.
8. Add the [`SecurityConfig.json`](SecurityConfig.json) security configuration to the JSON configuration you provided at step 5. 
9. Ensure you've replaced all placeholders (e.g., `solutions788` in the URIs) in the configuration with your own values.
10. Once you've create all three sources, [schedule a refresh operation](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1933/) every 10 minutes for your incremental indexing source.
11. [Add](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1645/) the [`FixFacebookURL.py`](Extensions/FixFacebookURL.py) indexing pipeline extension to your organization.
12. [Apply this extension](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1936/) to your incremental indexing source.
13. [Create the appropriate fields and mappings](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/#completion).
14. Check whether your source indexes the desired content properly. You might find you need an additional [indexing pipeline extension](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1645/) to achieve the expected result.


## Indexed content

* Groups (documenttype `GroupFB`)
* Groups > Posts (documenttype `PostFB`)
* Groups > Posts > Attachments (documenttype `AttachmentFB`)
* Groups > Posts > Comments (documenttype `CommentFB`)
* Groups > Docs (documenttype `DocFB`)
* Groups > Events (documenttype `EventFB`)
* Groups > Albums (documenttype `AlbumFB`)
* KnowledgeArticles (documenttype `KnowledgeFB`)
* Events (documenttype `WorkplaceEvents`). Events can be for specific groups or for the entire workplace.
* Members Infos (documenttype `WorplaceMember`, Manager(s), Reporter(s), Group(s), position...)


Attachments are completely downloaded and full text indexed.

Comments can contain nested comments, they are indexed as a single comment item (that is, comment + nested comments).

** Only Posts supports incremental indexing, be-aware of the duplicate entries in `RefreshEndpoints` **

### Folding

For Posts with Comments & Attachments folding is enabled.
For both the field `foldingcollection` is defined. For the parent (Posts), the field `foldingparent` is defined. For the childs (comments, attachments) the field `foldingchild` is defined.

### Custom fields

The following custom fields must be created:
| Field        | Type           | Features  |
| ------------- |-------------|-----|
| id       | string |  |
| groupid  | Integer 64 | |
| postid   | String | |
| mediaurl | String      |     |
| iconurl  | String     | |
| mymessage | String  | Free Text, Ranking, Stemming |
| mystory   | String  | Free Text, Ranking, Stemming |


## Security indexed

Workplace by Facebook is using security based upon Community Members and Group Members. The configuration indexes both.

## Limitation

Nested community groups are not supported

## Special attention

Posts can contain a message and/or a story. The field `mymessage` and/or `mystory` is added to the content. `message` is a better fit, so if that is there, use that one.
